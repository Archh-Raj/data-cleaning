correlation:
	A correlation analysis computes a correlation cosfficient

	correlation coefficient is a single number that shows the linear relation between
	two variables

	cor coe varies between -1 and +1
	+1 -> perfect positive linear ]
	relationship(can be prefectly predicted by it's value )
	-1 => perfect inverse linear relationship
	0 -> no linear relationship(there may other relationship)

	cor coe itself is a continuous measure of correlation strength
	A corresponding p-value must be computed to interpret its 
	statistical significance 

	Correlation merely shows a relationship

	It does not reveal or imply link or casuality

	causality can be demonstrated by experimental 
	manipulation

	Let's say ice cream buying count is correlated with shark attacks
	that doesn't mean if you buy more ice creams there will be more shark attacks 
	but both are independently correlated with season like in summer more people go
	to beach and also buy more icecreams

Pearson correlation can over or under represent relationships if they contain non 
 linearities or outliers
